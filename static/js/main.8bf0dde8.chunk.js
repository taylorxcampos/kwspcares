They are good, hard working boys in a very difficult time. Pat and Tyler lost their father at a very young age, then had to deal with being abandoned. Their grandmother, who they called Mom & Great-Grandmother stepped up to raise the boys and unfortunately they lost their long-time family home to Super Storm Sandy. Sandy took not only their home, but all their personal belongings as well. Homeless for a time then renting for a while, being evicted when their great grandmother passed away, rendering them homeless once again. Over the past few years they have bounced around from rental homes and hotel rooms. At times, have lived out of their mini-van. Throughout this time with the help of the Brick Township High School community, Pat and Tyler have remained focused on their goals. They each played 3 varsity sports throughout High School, while holding down full time jobs to help "Mom" with the bills. Pat and Tyler would come in from practice, shower, get dressed, and go to work each night after practices and on the weekends. The most amazing thing about Pat and Tyler is they each have NEVER missed a lifting, training or High School sport practice for any of the teams they were on during their 4 years in High School!!! They were always the hardest working boys on their teams. Since graduating from H.S. in 2018, the boys and "Mom" have been living in Wenke\'s Motel in Point Pleasant. They have been working full-time at Wendy\'s in Brick to help "Mom" with the bills along with attending Ocean County College. Soon after graduation "Mom" was diagnosed with cancer and had been in and out of hospitals until she recently passed away. The boys are currently on their own at the ages of 18 and 19. They ride their bikes to work or Uber if the weather is bad. They are currently trying to balance their college classes around their work schedule, and deal with the recent loss of "Mom". We are asking you to help these boys get their adult lives started off on the right foot. Remember, any amount whatsoever is a help, thank you very much. The funds raised are going to pay for food, future rent payments, obtaining driver licenses, securing a vehicle, and helping them create a stable and productive life. Thanks again, we appreciate any and all help. Please look for updates, as we will be sharing all the progress that is made with all your help and support!'))))),l.a.createElement("div",{className:"mike"},l.a.createElement("h6",null,"For more information contact Keller Williams Shore Properties"," ",l.a.createElement("br",null)," P: 732-797-9001"))))}}]),t}(n.Component);Boolean("localhost"===window.location.hostname||"[::1]"===window.location.hostname||window.location.hostname.match(/^127(?:\.(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)){3}$/));a(28);o.a.render(l.a.createElement(T,null),document.getElementById("root")),"serviceWorker"in navigator&&navigator.serviceWorker.ready.then(function(e){e.unregister()})}},[[19,1,2]]]);
